           "description":"A three-line poem of 5,7,5 syllables; haiku writers seek to capture a moment of perception. Haikus turn on strong natural images - using a word, called the kigo, that indicates the season - and relay intense emotions, often leading to spiritual insights. Contemporary haiku writers may drop the three-line requirement (often writing the poem as a single line) and/or the syllable count and/or the kigo."

Historically, tankas were combined with prose, linked together, and/or published to include exchanges of verse between poets. Subjects vary but often center on travel, love, and the seasons. As with haiku, in Japan today there are regular tanka competitions and a continuing appreciation of this form."

            "description":"A historical fixed form. The eight-line octave followed by the six-line sestet held numerical significance: it could be reduced to 4 and 3 and the total, 7. All three numbers were important in music composition as well as in religious thinking, four signifying the world and three the trinity, and so on. The Italian sonnet consists of an octave rhyming abbaabba and a sestet rhyming cdcdcd. The English sonnet, which developed out of the Italian, consists of fourteen line of iambic pentameter verse: three quatrains and a closing couplet, with a rhyme scheme of abab, cdcd, efef, gg. Poets have always adapted this structure, observing most consistently only its fourteen-line length."
