## For Developers

This method will not require further set up; everything you need to get   
started will be in the zip file.

To access the Bootstrap plugins:
  Include the CSS link for every Bootstrap plugin you want to use:   
```<link href= "css/<desired plugin>.css" rel="style-sheet">```    
  Include the javascript file:  
```<script src="js/<desired plugin.js"></script> ```

#### JQuery
*Note: JQuery is required to work with Bootstrap's javascript plugins

Include this JQuery API call in your file header as a script:
   
   ``` <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
    ```
